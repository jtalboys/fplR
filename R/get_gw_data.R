#' Function to extract data for a specific player(s) from a certain gameweek or weeks.
#' 
#' @param players a vector of players, referred to either using their ID's (numerical
#' vector) or names (character vector).
#' as they are written in the id_lookup data frame. I would reccomend using the players
#' ID's due to potential issues with special characters.
#' @param gw The FPL Gameweek to pull data for, a vector of integers between 1 and 38.
#' Note that if gameweeks chosen haven't been played yet then data won't be displayed for them.
#' Defaults to all gameweeks.
#' 
#' @return A data frame, with one row of data for each chosen player for each chosen gameweek.
#' The data has 29 variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{name}{Player name}
#'    \item{opponent}{Team played against in this round}
#'    \item{total_points}{Total fpl points earned in this gameweek}
#'    \item{was_home}{Boolean - did the player play at home?}
#'    \item{team_h_score, team_a_score}{Number of goals scored by the home or away team}
#'    \item{round}{The Gameweek}
#'    \item{minutes}{Minutes played by the player in this gameweek}
#'    \item{goals_scored, assists, clean_sheets, goals_conceded, own_goals, penalties_saved,
#'    penalties_missed, yellow_cards, red_cards, saves}{Statistics related to the players performance in this gameweek}
#'    \item{bonus}{fpl bonus points awarded to the player in this gameweek}
#'    \item{bps}{Points allocated to the player by the fpl bonus points system - used to determine how many bonus point player should be awarded}
#'    \item{influence, creativity,threat, ict_index}{Values calculated by fpl algorithms}
#'    \item{value}{The cost of the player in this gameweek  (Â£m)}
#'    \item{transfers_balance, transfers_in, transfers_out}{Figures relating to how many managers transferred this player in/out for this gameweek}
#'    \item{selected}{Number of fpl managers selected by}}
