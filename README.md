# fplR
Package that provides wrappers around the fantasy premier league (fpl) API!

# TODO:
* Create data frames with as much information in as possible - particularly need one which maps player names to the corresponding API's that are needed to obtain that players data. 
* Figure out what functions are useful - write them...
* Maybe incorporate some web scraping of players on the injury list, this can be found [here](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/player-news)
